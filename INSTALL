INSTALLATION

TransDb installation procedure is exactly the same way that most Python packages.

Note that TransDb will be installed in your default Python packages directory, so
you'll probably need root privileges to install TransDb to this directory.

To install TransDb in your default site-packages directory run (inside this directory):

    python setup.py install

To install directly from subversion run (inside directory where you want to install):

    svn checkout http://transdb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/transdb/ transdb

Actually, it can be installed copying transdb directory to any directory included in PYTHON_PATH.

REQUIREMENTS

TransDb requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django newforms-admin branch.
